This repo is a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model that predicts the thermal conductivity of Paraffin-expanded graphite composites. We generated the dataset using the QSGS(quartet structure generation set) and simulated the corresponding thermal conductivity using the LBM(Lattice Boltzmann Method).
